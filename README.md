# ros2-pytorch

In this work, we do end-to-end pipeline for deep learning with ROS2. DALI+APEX (Training) --> ROS2+PyTorch (Inference)

We explore Classification and Object Detection tasks on Custom Dataset

1. Train with NVIDIA DALI and APEX libraries
2. Inference using PyTorch and integration with ROS2 node
